# CS-230 Software Design Document

- Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
  - The Gaming Room is a company that has a game called Draw It or Lose It that is currently only available on the Android app store. 
  - The client wanted us to develop a web-based game based on their current game to serve mulitple platforms. They wanted the game to have to ability to have one or more teams involved. They also needed each team to have mulitple players assigned to it, as well as unique game and team names to make sure no duplicates names were in use for each instance of the game. They also required that only one instance of the game be in memory at any given time, which can be done by creating unique ids for each instance of a game, team, or player.  

- What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
  - What I think I did particularly well in developing this documentation was the Evaluation section which went over the charactheristics, advantages, and weaknesses of each operating system. I felt that I did well at explaining each section well enough that even someone unfamiliar with the different system could understand the differences. 

- What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

- How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
